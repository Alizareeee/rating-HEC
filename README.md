- You have be be able to install MongoDB in you machine.(follow the instruction [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/))
- Fire MongoDB servive on the other folder tht you made and make a database document named `candidateList` nad just leave it like that
- Go to the folder that you have downloaded project. you have to see `server.js` and `package.json` files here.
- Type in this  folder `npm install` which  installs all of the required dependencies for the front and back end
- Type `node serve.js` will run the server file which push all of the files to you localhost in browser.
- Prefably use Chrome now. and type `http://localhost:8000/` in url. You will see the the home page of your packages.
- You dont have candidates now. but you can start adding them.  Remember that all of these candiate are only on your local machine.
